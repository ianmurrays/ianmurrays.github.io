# What I'm doing professionally

I'm working at [Sandbox.Ventures][4] since November 2025 as a Software Engineer, building different projects with Ruby on Rails.

# What I'm doing personally

I have recently taken up photography, after I purchased a (used) Canon EOS 1100D. You can find some of what I shoot at [my instagram][2] and [Unsplash][3].
