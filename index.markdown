about_text: >-
  With over 15 years building software, I've worked across the full stack — from
  large iOS applications and single-page apps in Angular, to full-stack Ruby on Rails
  applications and billing systems built from scratch. I focus on architecture,
  testing, and maintainability, shipping code that's built to last.
